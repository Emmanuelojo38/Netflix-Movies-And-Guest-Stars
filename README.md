# Netflix-Movies-And-Guest-Stars
- My friend has also been brushing up on her Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For her first order of business, she has been performing some analyses, and she believed that the average duration of movies has been declining.

- As evidence of this, she had provided me with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.

- If I'd be working with this data, I know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first I'll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Start by creating a Python object dictionary!
